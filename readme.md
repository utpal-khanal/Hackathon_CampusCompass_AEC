## <strong>Title:</strong> A Campus Wayfinding Application


## <strong>Problem Statement:</strong>
Navigating through a large campus such as in universities, colleges, and hospitals can be a daunting task for newcomers or anyone who is unfamiliar with the layout of the campus. The same is true in case of hospitals as there are a large number of departments and chambers, making it difficult for people to navigate. While external maps and GPS based systems are available, indoor navigation systems are not yet available, thus creating a need for such technology. Moreover, satellites cannot recognize the internal architecture of the buildings present on the campus, so having a virtual 3D architecture of the campus will be valuable.


## <strong>Solution:</strong>
Our solution involves using 3D maps of a campus to create a user-friendly campus wayfinding application. Our application will allow users to input their source and destination, and provide them with the shortest route to reach their destination. The source and destination can be any points inside the campus, and the options will be provided in the application. Our user-friendly application and accurate 3D map of the campus will help newcomers and unfamiliar people to navigate the campus with ease. 


## <strong>Technologies Used:</strong>
